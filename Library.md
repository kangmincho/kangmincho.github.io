description: >
  Since August 2021, I have been working at a public library which fulfills my compulsory military service in South Korea. I have been reading books in the library which covers international fiction(sci-fi, YA, mystery, historical, realistic), math, astronomy, statistics, environment, philosophy, biography, art and various branches of social science. 
  This is a place for my personal book review, written in either Korean or English. More info at my another Instagram site @lilybooks_archive.
